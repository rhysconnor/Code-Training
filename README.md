# Code-Training
Repo of just some coding challenges to learn Java

Best practice is to create your own local branch and work from there, then commit the code and push to master after. Stick to a easy to read naming convention for the code you are working on 
e.g Odd.java for sorting or retriving odd numbers
e.g StringConvert.java for converting ints to a string etc etc.


You can also add comments to the code by using this operator "//" to explain your code or to maybe give some tips on how to improve code
